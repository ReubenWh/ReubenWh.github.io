Attabotics were concerned that any disruption to the wireless communication could result in an Ant moving in an unexpected and uncontrolled manner. If this occurred while the Ant was at the picking station, there was a risk of serious injury to the operator, despite the presence of protective safety light curtains.To address this concern, DCA developed a concept in which the product bins were separated from the Ants before being presented to the operator at the picking station. The mechanism by which this was achieved is powered and controlled via a hard wired system, removing the uncertainty associated with wireless communications, while the bins are physically locked in position at the picking station, removing any risk of unexpected movements.","textStyle":"p"},{"type":"text","text":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System","textStyle":"b"}]},{"type":"row","children":[{"type":"image","src":"/projects/stori lab/10_1.png","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"},{"type":"image","src":"/projects/stori lab/14_1.png","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"}]},{"type":"image","src":"/projects/stori lab/13_2.png","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"},{"type":"image","src":"/projects/stori lab/PXL_20250211_175005530.jpg","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"}]},{"id":"drum","title":"Music Therapy Drum","linkimage":"/projects/drum/viscleaned.png","bannerimage":"/projects/drum/PXL_20240618_104827273.jpg","href":"/project/drum","tags":["Branding","UI"],"description":"","content":[{"type":"image","src":"/projects/drum/PXL_20240223_151133868.jpg","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"},{"type":"image","src":"/projects/drum/PXL_20240307_161216787.jpg","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"},{"type":"image","src":"/projects/drum/PXL_20240308_135040385.jpg","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"},{"type":"image","src":"/projects/drum/PXL_20240312_174344680.jpg","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"},{"type":"image","src":"/projects/drum/PXL_20240314_172523506.LONG_EXPOSURE-01.COVER.jpg","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"},{"type":"image","src":"/projects/drum/PXL_20240321_125813904.jpg","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"},{"type":"image","src":"/projects/drum/PXL_20240604_082300367.jpg","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"},{"type":"image","src":"/projects/drum/viscleaned.png","alt":"Detailed view of Snabb Proto System"}]},{"id":"snabb","title":"Snabb Proto System","linkimage":"/projects/snabb/0.jpg","bannerimage":"/projects/snabb/9hero shot 2.jpg","href":"/project/snabb","tags":["Branding","UI"],"description":"Creativity is essential to education, yet students often leave without strong problem-solving or creative thinking skills.
